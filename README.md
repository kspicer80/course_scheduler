 Code to help faculty members create course schedules based on the courses they've already completed ... Script takes in .json data that has a "Y" in a particular required course if already completed, if "N" than that one still needs to be completed.

 It then determines which courses are missing for each student and even returns the courses that the most number of students who need it.  Actually, it returns it for all the courses ...
